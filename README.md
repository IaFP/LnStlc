## Type soundness of the call-by-value STLC in a locally nameless representation

See https://www.chargueraud.org/softs/ln/. We mechanize in Agda a proof of type
soundness in λ→, the call-by-value simply typed λ-calculus. The same is done by
https://github.com/plclub in https://github.com/plclub/metalib in Coq, albeit
they more broadly modularize the library for reuse and prove additional results
on both λ→ as well as F<:, System F with subtyping.
