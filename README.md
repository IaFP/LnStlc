## Type soundness of the call-by-value STLC in a locally nameless representation

See https://www.chargueraud.org/softs/ln/. We mechanize in Agda a proof of type
soundness in λ→, the call by value STLC. The same is done by @plclub in
@plclub/metalib in Coq, albeit they more broadly modularize the library for
reuse and prove additional results on both λ→ as well as F<:, System F with
subtyping.
